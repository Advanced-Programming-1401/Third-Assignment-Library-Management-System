1- getting stock in infinite loop when we enter invalid user_name or password in functions:
    - userSignUp
    - userLogin
    - librarian login
2- getting execution failed in userSignUp and librarianSignIn. Because:
    - we return a null after each failed function calling, if after a failed calling we our calling succeed we get an error
