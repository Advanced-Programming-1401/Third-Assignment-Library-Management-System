# Library Management System

## Introduction
In this assignment, you will create an object-oriented Java program that can manage a library. The program will allow users to search for books, borrow and return books, and manage the library inventory. The program should be designed using object-oriented programming principles.

## Objectives
- Review the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and utilize them correctly
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of Encapsulation
- Learn the difference between Static and Instance variables
- Use Git for version control and collaborate on a codebase
- Write a report on the assignment

## Requirements
- Java 8 or later
- Git
- Maven or Gradle

## Tasks
1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your local machine. Ensure to create a new Git branch before starting your work
2. Implement a menu for the library that allows:
    - Users to login, logout, borrow and return books
    - Librarians to login, logout, add or delete books
3. Your program should keep a list of all users (and the books they've borrowed), all librarians, and all books
4. Implement an interactive menu in the command line.
...
7. Commit your changes and push them to your own fork on Github

## Notes
1. You are allowed to add new functions and classes to your code where you see fit.
2. 

## Evaluation
- Your code should compile and run without any errors
- Your code should be well-organized, readable, properly commented and follows clean code principles
- Your code should follow OOP principles and correctly use Java access modifiers
- You should use Git for version control and include meaningful commit messages

## Bonus Objectives
1. Perform Input Validation: Ensure the data or information entered by a user or system is correct, complete, and appropriate for the intended use. For instance, a user shouldn't be able to borrow the same book twice, or return a book they haven't borrowed yet.
2. Extend the User and Librarian class to create a more complex login system. Your menu should allow new users to create an account by providing a username and a password. Prevent new users choosing a previously taken username. Authenticate each user before logging in.
3. Implement Encapsulation in your code to protect the data and ensure that it can only be accessed through the defined setter/getter functions.
4. Add a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for your project using either Swing or JavaFX. This GUI should include all of the options offered by the command line menu you implemented earlier. 

## Submission
- Push your code to your fork on Github
- Upload your report to your fork on GitHub

The deadline for submitting your code is Wdnesday, March 8 (17th of Esfand). Any commits made after this date will not affect your score.

Good luck and happy coding!
