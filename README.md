# Library Management System

## Introduction
In this assignment, I create an object-oriented Java program that can manage a library. The program  allow users to search for books, borrow and return books, and manage the library inventory.
##  Summary
in this project,I created an ArrayList for librarians, users, books, and returned books.
There are 4 class . In the Book class, I include fields for the title, author, ISBN, and year of publication. and i put the set and get functions of the books to setup the info of the books.
Secondly, in the Librarian class, I define functions for managing the list of users and books, as well as adding or removing users or books from the library inventory. The Librarian class also includes a login function that verifies the username and password entered by the librarian.
But as you should know librarian has an option that user hasn't.
For example It's logical for librarian to see the users list and librarians list and add or remove book or users or librarians.
Although users can rent and return books.
Finally, there are some functions in the Librarian class that are shared with the Book and User classes, such as the ability to search for a book or view a list of borrowed books.

## Conclusion
If you want to revise it or make it better, you can create a GUI for the program. and you can contain other condition that I didn't consider.
For example date of returning book, you can make  different between sign up and login.
